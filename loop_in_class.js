Write a for loop that will iterate from  to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (ex: "2 is even").

Create a function called verbing. It should take a singel argument,
a string,. If its length is at least 3, it shoudl add "ing" to its
end, unless it already ends in "ing", in which case it should add "ly"
instead. If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it
unchanged. For example:

verbing("swim"): "swimming"
verbing("swimming"): "swimmingly"
verbing("go"): "go"
