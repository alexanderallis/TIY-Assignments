A defective reflective entry:

Something technical that I didn’t know before:

Everything. But I wasn’t entirely tabula rasa when I came.
I had html and CSS pretty much on lock and a basic understanding
of how the internet worked. One of the biggest things that I’ve
learned, though, is how everything fits together. I finally see
the bigger picture -how the page relates to the JavaScript, what
jQuery does and why it’s useful, what an API and JSON file is
(which are extremely powerful), and a ton of tertiary subjects
from lodash to Sass. I love Sass.

Out of everything I have learned, though, JavaScript is the biggest
and most important part. I find everything that is possible with
JavaScript quite exciting. The turning point for me was the
multi-column form. After I completed it, I realized I was able to
harness the user’s information and do whatever I wanted with it.
This ability was compounded in the appointment app, where we took
the information, stored it, and presented it to the user in a
systematic way.

One challenge I faced since starting the program:

It’s been hard to get “in the swing of things.” The first week
was all adrenaline, the second was a crash, and the third was me
trying to find how I related to the process of the Iron Yard. And
I mean this in terms of sustenance, society, and phycho-circadian
functionality.

And how I think I have overcome the challenge:

I think I have finally reached a satisfactory level of operation
in these three areas. Not everything is perfect yet, but I’m getting
pretty close. I go to bed somewhat early and get things from the
grocery store a couple times per week. As Maslow stated, once I
have met my fundamental animal needs I can achieve my “uber-self.” haha.
